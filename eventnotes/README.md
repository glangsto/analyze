### analyize: Tools for Analyzing very short duration Flash Events
Commands to Plot/Analyze Events by mutiple radio Telescopes
* E     - Function to plot Event time series.
* MATCH - Matches events from Multiple Telescopes.  Producea a plot counts events in time ranges.

### Python:

* '*.eve' - Raw time series samples of events.  The I/Q samples are recorded separately, but I and Q samples alternate in time.

* events    - Directory of observations of detected events.

The neutral hydrogen in the galactic plan is seen in these observations,  (only about 1/30 of a second averaging).
The peak intensity is about 10 K, with an RMS of roughly 1 K.

The counts per hour for the end of February 16, all of February 17 and the beginning of February 18 are
shown in the plot below. Only events detected with signficance greater than 6 sigma are counted:
